# One stop for all free and important links related with Data Science and Machine Learning

## How much `Math` is to much math for Data Science:
1. Be comfortable with
  * `Linear Algebra/Matrix Calculus`, check this [Link](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) if you are not comfortable => so you don’t get stuck on notation
  * `Introductory Probability`, chech this [Link](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)if you are not comfortable <br>
